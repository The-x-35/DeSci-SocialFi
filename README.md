# DeSci SocialFi Platform

A decentralized platform for researchers and doctors that combines blockchain-based reputation scoring with SocialFi elements. This app facilitates collaboration, incentivizes quality contributions, and rewards valuable interactionsâ€”all built using Next.js 13 with TypeScript and styled with a modern dark theme.

---

## Overview

The DeSci SocialFi Platform addresses key challenges in the scientific and medical communities:
- **Fragmented Recognition:** Traditional systems can obscure individual contributions. Our blockchain-based reputation system ensures transparent and fair recognition.
- **Collaboration Barriers:** Researchers and doctors can easily share research, submit contributions, and engage in peer reviews.
- **Inadequate Incentives:** Token-based rewards incentivize high-quality contributions and active community engagement.

## Features

- **Decentralized Collaboration:** Create, share, and review contributions in a trustless environment.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Simulated Solana blockchain functions for wallet connectivity and reputation scoring.
- **Token Incentives:** Reward quality contributions with tokens.
- **Modern Dark Theme:** Enjoy a sleek, dark-themed UI with smooth transitions and responsive design.
- **Next.js 13 Structure:** Built using the new **app** directory structure for improved routing and performance.
